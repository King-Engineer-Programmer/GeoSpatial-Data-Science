# GeoSpatial-Data-Science (in progress)

Is this project, GeoPandas is used for reading and storing geospatial data, exploratory data analysis, preparing data for use in statistical models (feature engineering, dealing with outlier and missing data, etc.), and simple plotting.  Statsmodels is used for statistical inference as it provides more detail on the explanatory power of individual explanatory variables and a framework for model selection.  Scikit-learn is used for machine learning applications as it includes many advanced machine learning algorithms, as well as tools for cross-validation, regularization, assessing model performance, and others.

This data related to biodiversity in Mexico. I will use linear regression, Poisson Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random Forests, K-NN classification, and unsupervised classification methods such as PCA and K-means clustering. 

The cleaning and analysis will be done in Jupyter Notebook, then imported into use SQL in Azure to make queries.
